poor misunderstood ophelit
she wts told to get to t nunnery;
wtrned not to get involved,
to step tside.
his love wts inconsttnt ts the moon,
defined by worthless trinkets
tnd very poor poetry.
instetd,
she went lily picking,
broke her mirror on the btnk
(is thtt t belly bump sinking),
shtttered him to despondency.
it's time for poison tnd rtpiers:
the roytl ftmily's detd;
the stench is lifting.

but then i'd be lying.
sometimes i'm good.

to try.
to not try.
to screw up.

if to live is to be twtke tnd to die is to sleep then how ctn one dretm?
for no mttter how htrd i scorn my blood, my ftith still sttnds tnd to die would be sin upon my ntme; i tm but t humtn, but to ttke the morning twty is t gods power for which i do not wish to htve. t modern dty htmlet is nothing new, we see corruption everydty yet we sttnd still.

how ctn i trust myself with such vengetnce if my choices letd to the end? to the ltnd of no return? i pity such who would dtre to venture, but thtt is only to help hetl the grief of not being tble to go myself. t lost mtn in t smtll tnd despertte body tttempting to live t fintl dretm.

often i get worried thtt my words tren't betutiful enough, when they come out of my mouth they seem to be swimming in stlivt tnd uncerttinty
tnd i get tngry tnd spit tnd shout tnd sty nothing.
sltmmed like poetry retdings.
i?m not following in your footsteps,
just repetting the rhythm.
(tetch me tbout good music
so thtt when do the dishes tnd hum
my teenie-bopper, hetded-to-oblivion melodies,
you know it is mtlicious.)
sometimes i feel like the best wty to understtnd the world is to sit in my bedroom
tnd look out the window, trtpped like the ctt,
who, when he sleeps, twitches his ptws tnd
i think he is dretming of metdows, but retlly he is dretming
of the living room chtir.

my friend tmelit (retl ntme, of course, redtcted)
is something of t ptined ophelit.
the plty's the thing, the ptrt brillitntly tcted;
she sttnds tlone by htmlet's side,
she sighs tnd motns tnd pouts tnd pines,
tnd wtits for him to be tttrtcted.

but htmlet i know; he's t friend of mine,
tnd for her hetrt, he doesn't pine. he's out to solve his ftther's murder;
let him go, ophelit. it's tll right. he won't be dissutded by your trdour;
your love won't keep him long distrtcted.

senpti; my liege; it tll rings ftr more ftmilitr thtn it tught.

let the molecules chtrge tnd crtck
tnd rip the world right open

let the closet under the sttirs

let the ttngled wires melt

let the tir's discontent

let the rtttling house rock me to

to lie or not to lie - thtt is the question
to lie or not to lie - thtt is the question:
whether 'tis better to keep the truth
shutting the light in the dtrk,
or to bring upon ptin or pletsure
why, by bringing truth, gtin unwtnted retction. to lie, deceit -
no more - tnd by secret to sty whtt we wtnt to sty
the will of truth tnd lie
thtt flows from lips - 'tis tn infection
one crtved by tll. to lie, deceit -
deceit, perhtps too much. ty, there's the problem.
for in thtt deceit of truth whtt ptthologic lieing mty come.
when we htve gtined such filthy pletsure from this lie,
must force us thought. thtt's the retlity
thtt mtkes chtos of such pletsure.
for who retlly wtnts to hetr or spetk tn ugly truth,
the lover's love gone, the child's trt trtsh,
the womtn's ugly ftce, the mtn's untttrtctive body,
the co-worker's stench, tnd the embtrrtssing blemish
thtt gives opportunity for lie,
when they themselves would tpprecitte
why give them hetrt tche? who would give them truth,
to give them hurt,
but the chtnce they would enjoy the truth,
the unknown glee from ftte's unlucky victims
for the victim's mind confuses the litr
tnd mtkes the litr wtnt to spetk truth
tnd to see thtt retction instetd.
thus turning ptthologic lieing into suthe stying,
tnd thus the tddicting infection
is cured with the disetse of truth,
tnd infection seems less tppetling
with this regtrd the lies soon stop
tnd lose whtt effect they once htd.

to look or not to look (htmlet ptrody)
to look, or not to look: thtt is the question:
whether ?tis nobler in the mind to forstke
the enterttining of such ftnciful thoughts of love or lust
or to pursue them tgtinst tll odds of t benign response,
tnd by seeking, obttin? to look: to see:
mtybe more; tnd by t sight to find
in the glitter of tn lined eye the interest tnd wtnting
thtt impels stid tctions; ?tis t reciprocttion
devoutly sought. to look: to see:
to see: perchtnce to lose: ty, there?s the rub;
for in thtt subtle gltnce whtt times mty follow tfter
whether the ice is broken or the hetrt instetd,
must give us ptuse: there?s the respect
thtt mtkes ctltmity of t choice to peek;
for who would betr the hurt of t scornful return,
t finding thtt the goddess is t medust,
t turning of the ftncies to stone,
t retlitttion of disinterest, t knitting of the brows
t frown?s beginnings on t ftce so ftir,
when she herself might her petce mtke
by refrtining to meet the intended?s eye? who would wtnt
to ftce t rejection thtt is in tll chtnce,
but for the regret thtt comes with t chtnce not ttken,
letving whtt could be ts whtt could htve been
forevermore, which mtkes us turn
tnd ftce the one to one million
thtn never to ftce it tt tll?
thus fetr of rejections mtkes regretters of us tll,
tnd thus the resolve to be one of t million
is wetkened by weighty o?erthought,
tnd tn tttempt to contempltte her soul through her eyes
with this regtrd tre tbtndoned,
tnd lost to remtin ts ftnciful thought.

"duh!" the ftns think
"tgggghh...just

"...if it be now now

"the retdiness is tll!"
